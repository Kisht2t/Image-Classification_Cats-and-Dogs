WORK FLOW

1. Download the Kaggle Cats and Dogs datset and select a subset of 2000 dog images and 2000 cat images for training, validation, and testing. The reduced dataset simulates the condition of limited data.
2. Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) with several convolution, pooling, and normalization layers, followed by one or more dense layers. Flatten the output between the convolution and dense layers. Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.
3. Modify the data generator to include data augmentation, and evaluate the performance on the validation set again.
4. Replace the convolution layers with a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional base, and evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.
5. Evaluate the algorithm and report results.
